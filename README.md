This is a simple etch-a-sketch program developed using HTML, CSS, and
vanilla JavaScript. Dragging the mouse across the grid will change
the background color of the underlying div. The grid and all divs
within it are generated using CSS Grid. The "Reset" button clears the
grid and sets the size back to 16x16; the "Set Resolution" button
allows the user to set a custom resolution from 1-100; the "Random
Colors" button generates a random RGB value for the underlying div
instead of setting its background color to black; and the "Darken
Mode" button makes the background color of the underlying div 10%
darker (in comparison to the original RGB value of the div when the
button is clicked, NOT 10% of each current RGB value). This project
demonstrates knowledge and proper usage of event listeners, regular
expressions, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
